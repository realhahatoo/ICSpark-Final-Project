  <h1>Welcome to my ICSpark Final Project Website!</h1>
    
  <p>
      Before I began working on my final project, I took the time to try and think of what my final project would be! 
      I couldn't think of anything so I used what ICSpark already provided, THE IDEAS!
  </p>
  
  <ul>
      <li><button id = "quizButton" >A Personality Quiz</button> – Make a personality quiz out of your favorite game or show! Use JavaScript to ask questions and decide on what the quiz taker's character is!</li>
      <li><button id = "clickerButton" >A Cookie Clicker Game</button> – Clicking on a picture increases your score, and you can make upgrades to increase your score further! It doesn't have to be a cookie, either! It can be whatever you want, it's your website!</li>
      <li><button id = "madLibsButton" >Advanced Mad Libs Creator</button> – If you liked the Mad Libs project from Week 5, you can build onto it by adding more and more scenarios!</li>
      <li><button id = "wikiButton" >Wiki</button> – If you have a favorite game or show you want to make your own wiki about, make it! You can have multiple pages on your website.</li>
      <li><button id = "RPGButton" >Choose Your Own Adventure Game</button> – The website gives the user a scenario and a choice, and each choice will lead them down a new path in a story of your creation!</li>
      <li><button id = "studyButton" >Flashcard Study Website</button> – Want to test your friends, or help them study for something? Make a website that has interactable flashcards that give the answer when clicked!</li>
      <li><button id = "triviaButton" >Trivia Game</button> – If you have tricky trivia questions to ask about a TV series, a game, or even about yourself, make a trivia website for others to tackle!</li>
      <li><button id = "button" >Whatever You Want!</button> – It's your website! As long as you believe you can finish it in a couple of weeks, go for it! Your mentors will be there to help you if you ever get stuck!</li>
    </ul>
